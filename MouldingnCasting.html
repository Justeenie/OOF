                    <p>
                        The process of moulding and casting is very simple. A mould could be thought of as a cavity or
                        shell which is made from the imprints
                        of any given object. The mould could be made out of materials such as moudling sand, rubber,
                        clay, resin and many more. Once the mould
                        is made, we then continue on with casting which is basically to add material, usually in liquid
                        state, into the mould and let it take
                        the mould's shape and harden before extracting it out. Casting material can range from metals
                        such as brass to lighter materials such as
                        plastic and wax.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this modules, we were to make a pre-mould out of foam, then create the mould using silicon,
                        and finally finish it with adding our material
                        of choice for casting. In my case, I chose wax as I wanted to make a candle.

                    <h2>Making the pre-mould</h2>

                    

                    <p>
                        To make the pre-mould, I need to design a 3D model of the object I want to cast, along with a
                        shell so that I can make my mould. This pre-mould
                        would be cut using the CNC machine in the FabLab (stepcraft420V2 currently). If you have not
                        seen how I operated the machine you could refer to
                        the <a href="PCB Design and Fabrication.html">PCB Design and Fabrication page of my website</a>
                        where I showed how I used the CNC machine to create
                        my own PCB. Using it to create my pre-mould is not too different other than how I generated the
                        Gcode.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this modules, we were to make a pre-mould out of foam, then create the mould using silicon,
                        and finally finish it with adding our material
                        of choice for casting. In my case, I chose wax as I wanted to make a candle.
                    </p>

                    <div class="mncimgdiv">
                        <img src="premould.png" class="mncimg">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The first step for me was to create a 3D model of my pre-mould using Fusion 360. I measured the
                        piece of foam provided before hand to ensure that
                        the size of my pre-mould could fit. The height is especially important in this case. As you can
                        see from above, the heart-shaped candle that I
                        eventually want to cast is in the centre of the pre-mould, and I have also added a shell around
                        to create a boundary for the mould.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next on the list, I have to tweak the settings for the CNC machine, basically telling it how I
                        want it to be milled, how detailed it should be and
                        the fast it should go. I used the settings recommended by the lecturer and changed some to
                        better suit my design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With all that done, I just create the nc programme using the STEPCRAFT UCCNC post processing
                        library and everything is good to go.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started the CNC milling machine up and started my programme. At this point, setting the z-axis
                        zero accurately is not too important and can be done
                        manually by slowly lowering the drill bit. The important part is to ensure that the drill bite x
                        and y axis are set to the centre of the foam so that
                        it does not cut beyond the boundaries of the foam block. With that in mind, the video above
                        shows what the milling process looked like for my design.

                    <h2>Casting the Silicon Mould</h2>

                    <p>
                        Once the milling ends, I took out my pre-moulds and got ready to use silicon to cast my actual
                        mould. Silicon is great because its flexible and easy
                        obtain. I was provided with two cans, the first can contains the silicon itself and the second
                        can contains a hardener. I refered to a datasheet to know
                        the correct ratio to mix the two. I used a weighing scale to measure weight to ensure my ratio
                        is as close to the suggested ratio as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I then mixed them for about 5 minutes before pouring them into the foam pre-mould. I ensured not
                        to stir for too long as it may affect the curing (hardening)
                        process later. The curing process takes about 1 full day according to the datasheet, but in my
                        experience, depending on the size of the mould it took up to 2
                        full days before my moulds were fully cured.

                    <p>
                        I extracted the silicon moulds out of the foam and scraped away as much foam inside as possible
                        to prevent the foam from disrupting the casting process.

                        I wanted to make candles, therefore I had to find a wax along with finding a way to heat it up.
                        The decided to use an old unused candle I found, aluminium foil
                        and a lighter to heat up the wax and some cloth rope as a wick. As you can see from above I wore
                        a rubber glove to take precaution against the aluminium foil
                        getting too hot for me to hold.

                    <p>
                        With the wax melted, I poured it into the silicon mould and let it rest to allow the wax to
                        solidify.

                        As it was cooling down, I placed the wick into the wax to allow it to be used as a candle.

                    <p>
                        Finally, I removed the candle out of the silicon mould and this is how it looked on the top and 
                        on the bottom. With that, my candle was casted successfully!
