                        PCB is an abbreviation for printed circuit board. They are the most important part of any
                        functioning electronic device.
                        They mainly support and connect various electronic components such as microcontrollers,
                        resistors, capacitors and many
                        other parts using traces. Above, you can see a model of what the components and traces look
                        like.

                    <p>
                        In this modules, we were taught how to design and fabricate our own pcb from scratch using
                        software such as EAGLE, and
                        hardware such as a CNC machine.

                    <h2>PCB Fabrication [ISP Board]</h2>
                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="isptraces.png" class="ispimg"><img src="ispoutline.png" class="ispimg">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        To get started, I first had to fabricate an ISP board to allow me to programme other boards. As
                        shown above, I was provided
                        with the files for both the traces and outline for the pcb board as shown above.
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="mods.png" class="pcbimg">
                    </div>


                    <p>
                        Next, I used a programme provided by our lecturer called <a
                            href="https://skeatz.github.io/mods/">Mods</a>. Which provides a
                        method to convert a png image (such as the one shown previously) into a Gcode that a CNC machine
                        will be able to read.
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="modstraces.png" class="pcbimg">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Following that, I selected a server programme under G-code called "mill 2D PCB png". I uploaded
                        the png files provided to me,
                        selected 'mill traces' and input the settings recommended to me by the lecturer. The only
                        important consideration that I had to
                        make is to decide the value of the Offset. Basically, the the offset value represents how many
                        times the milling machine cut
                        the traces, therefore, the higher the offset value, the more rounds the milling machine will
                        cut, the thinner the traces. It
                        is always faster to cut the traces with the offset of 1, but sometimes I will cut with higher
                        offsets as it makes soldering
                        easier since there is more space in between the traces and pads, preventing me from soldering
                        the traces together causing a
                        short-circuit. Finally, I clicked on 'calculate' to get the Gcode generated.
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="modsoutline.png" class="pcbimg">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I repeated the process for the outline too, remembering to switch to 'mill outline' and changing
                        the settings accordingly. Outline
                        in this case will always be 1, as it would be enough to cut the PCB out of the copper sheet.
                        With
                        all that done, I clicked on 'calculate' for the outline Gcode and I was ready to move on to the
                        next step, setting up the milling
                        machine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first step is to get what is known as a copper blank. It is an insulator with a layer of
                        copper on the top. I applied double-sided
                        tape to the back of the blank and stuck it to the surface of the CNC machine while further using
                        masking tape to ensure it is secured
                        well. This is to prevent the copper blank from slipping during milling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Above is the User-Interface for the stepcraft CNC milling machine. All that I need to do is to
                        upload the Gcode file, then click "HOME ALL",
                        followed by setting zero for the x and y axis (ideally as close to the bottom-right corner of
                        the copper clad to save material).
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="z-zeroprobe.png" class="ispimg"><img src="z-zeroicon.png" class="ispimg">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Fortunately for me, the FabLab has a sensor to help as set the zero point for the z-axis very
                        easily. I just position the probe provided
                        under the drill, check from two different angles to ensure that it is aligned well, then click
                        the icon on the right shown above. The drill
                        will then slowly lower itself down until it 'clicks' the probe and sets the zero point
                        automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, I can switch the drill on and click on "CYCLE START" and monitor the machine as it mills.
                        In the event that anything goes wrong, I can
                        click on "CYCLE STOP" and adjust anything if needed and continue cutting. If its an emergency,
                        there is also a red emergency stop button I
                        could activate. The good news is that I never needed to use that button.
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">

                    <p>
                        While the milling is in progress, there will be copper chips (looks like powder) produced which
                        may obstruct the cutter, while it usually
                        would not affect the cutting, too much of it may cause the chips to fly out, making a mess and
                        also obstruct my view of the cutting. This
                        is problematic as it is important to check if the cutting is correct (not cutting too deep,
                        drill bit is not broken). To solve this, there
                        is a vacuum nearby that allows me to clean the board as it is being milled.
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">
                        <img src="ispboard.jpg" class="pcbimg">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        After milling, I removed the 'dead copper' to prevent issues when inserting it into the usb port
                        of a computer. Not all dead copper
                        has to be removed, only those that may cause short-circuits (such as the excess copper near the
                        usb adapter). I soldered all the smd
                        components with the help of a tweezer since they (especially the capacitors) are very small. One
                        tip I have been given by
                        Mr Chew, my lecturer, is to rest my arms and wrists on the table as much as possible to reduce
                        shaking. Next, I used a multimeter to
                        check for shorts/unconnected components. This was an important step as I might damage my
                        components if the ISP board is shorted, and
                        after checking, I realised that some components had weak connections (not soldered well) so I
                        resoldered them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the last few steps before I can use my ISP board to programme other boards. I followed
                        a set of instructions provided to me
                        to programme my board using an ISP board that has already been programmed by my lecturer. I
                        connected the programming pins to each other
                        and plugged my instructors ISP board into my computer
                    </p>

                    <div class="ispimgdiv">

                    <p>
                        Last but not least, I installed the fts firmware and used the "make -v" command to generate a
                        hex file. Then, I downloaded Zadig to install
                        the driver in my ISP and used the commands "make flash" and "make fuses" to finish the setup.
                        Now, I plug my own ISP programmer directly into
                        my laptop and check if device manager recognises it
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now, I plug my own ISP programmer directly into my laptop and check if Device Manager recognises
                        it. As you can see above, my computer recognises
                        my ISP board! This means it is working and I can blow the reset fuse using the "rstdisbl"
                        command. With this, my ISP board can be used to programme
                        other boards and is finally done!

                    <h2>PCB Design</h2>

                    <p>
                        Designing a PCB has two main steps, designing the schematic, and designing the board itself. The 
                        schematic is basically an electronic diagram that shows how all the electronic components are 
                        connected. Whereas the board design is the physical layout of how the board will actually look like 
                        along with how thin the traces should be and how the traces connect the components. I was tasked with 
                        creating a "hello board" that has leds and a button. If done correctly, I should be able to programme 
                        it with the ISP board above to do simple functions such as a blink programme.
